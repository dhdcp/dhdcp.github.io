	<br>I'm glad to inform you that I am officially in the DH internal management committee from today. 
	This provides a good opportunity to address some of our long standing administrative issues related to procurement, 
	infrastructure and facilities, salary, promotions, etc. 
	It will also help create a clear organogram, and our own set of rules, regulations in alignment with DH.
	<br><br>
	
	As your team leader your honest comments, criticisms and inputs are valuable to me at this stage. 
	This will help us plan for next steps and take some immediate actions as well. take few minutes to respond to the
	following questions. 
	I will not be able to see who submitted the responses because the forms don't require your identity.
